# currency_exchange_front
This website represents an enhanced version of the currency converter I developed for one of my recruitment assignments. In this iteration, I delved into learning Docker and Docker Compose. To deploy this website, you'll also need to have my backend(which I will publish later) set up to run alongside it within the Docker Compose environment.

Here's the link to previous version(recruitment assignment) recruit https://goody-converter.vercel.app/
